I love you very much. I’m sorry I’m not here with you now. I can’t wait for the homecoming.

I told u a wee while back that I wish I could show you when you are lonely or in darkness the astonishing light of your own being, but I think you’re finding it on your own. I can’t wait for our year together, and the ones after. 

I can’t promise an eight pack on my return, nor can I promise you a jacuzzi because that is 100% conditional. But I can promise a hot date and the best flatmate you’ve ever had.

Sincerely,

Future roomie
